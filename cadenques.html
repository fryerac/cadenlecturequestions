    <button class="accordion" id="section1">Outbreak and Early Stages</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        After World War I, many nations sought peace, but tensions rose as Germany, Italy, and Japan expanded their militaries. Britain and France attempted appeasement by allowing Germany to take some land, but this ultimately failed, setting the stage for World War II. In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, using Blitzkrieg tactics, while the Soviet Union invaded from the east on September 17. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the official beginning of World War II. Despite this, the early months of the war were relatively inactive for the Western Allies, a period known as the "Phoney War." Meanwhile, the Soviet Union used this time to invade Finland during the Winter War.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        In May 1940, Germany launched an invasion of France, bypassing the heavily fortified Maginot Line by attacking through Belgium and the Ardennes. This rapid advance led to the encirclement of Allied troops at Dunkirk, where over 300,000 British and French soldiers were successfully evacuated in Operation Dynamo. France soon fell, and the Germans established the Vichy government as a puppet regime. That summer, Germany attempted to gain air superiority over Britain in preparation for an invasion, leading to the Battle of Britain. Despite sustained bombing raids, including the Blitz, Britain's Royal Air Force successfully defended the country, marking Hitler’s first major defeat.

    <button class="accordion" id="section3">Alliances and Global Escalation</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        As war continued, the United States and Britain strengthened their alliance. In August 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter, outlining their vision for a post-war world based on self-determination and free trade. However, the war escalated further on December 7, 1941, when Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, destroying much of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. This led to the United States declaring war on Japan, followed by Germany and Italy declaring war on the U.S. four days later. Shortly after, Roosevelt and Churchill met in Washington in December 1941 to coordinate the war strategy, prioritizing the European theater over the Pacific.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Germany turned its attention to the Soviet Union with Operation Barbarossa, the largest land invasion in history, launched in June 1941. Initially, German forces made significant territorial gains using Blitzkrieg tactics, but as winter set in and Soviet resistance stiffened, the offensive stalled. This failure proved disastrous for Germany, leading to a prolonged and costly conflict on the Eastern Front. The Battle of Stalingrad, fought between July 1942 and February 1943, became one of the deadliest battles in history, with over a million casualties. Soviet forces encircled the German 6th Army, cutting off their supply lines, and Hitler’s refusal to allow retreat led to their eventual surrender. This marked a major turning point, as the Soviet Union began pushing German forces back.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        In North Africa, British and German forces clashed for control over strategic territory. Initially, Germany’s Afrika Korps, led by General Erwin Rommel, dominated the region. However, supply shortages and the decisive Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942 turned the tide in favor of the Allies. Soon after, the United States launched Operation Torch, its first large-scale land operation in North Africa. By May 1943, Axis forces surrendered in Tunisia, securing Allied control of the region and paving the way for the invasion of Italy.

    <button class="accordion" id="section6">Atlantic Warfare and Bombing Campaigns</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        At sea, the Battle of the Atlantic raged as Germany sought to disrupt Allied supply lines with U-boats. The battle, lasting from 1939 to 1945, was the longest continuous military campaign of the war. German naval power suffered a critical blow with the sinking of the battleship <em>Bismarck</em>, which had threatened British shipping before being hunted down and scuttled in May 1941. Meanwhile, Allied bombing campaigns targeted German industrial centers and cities. Some of the most controversial attacks included the firebombing of Dresden in February 1945, which resulted in heavy civilian casualties, and the strategic destruction of submarine bases to weaken Germany’s U-boat operations.

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <button class="accordion" id="section7">D-Day and Western Europe Liberation</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        By mid-1944, the Allies launched Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day, on June 6. This was the largest amphibious invasion in history, with Allied forces landing on the beaches of Normandy. Deception tactics misled German defenses into expecting an attack elsewhere, while airborne troops were deployed to support the invasion. Despite heavy casualties, the Allies successfully secured a foothold in France, leading to the rapid liberation of Western Europe. As Germany’s situation worsened, Hitler ordered one final major offensive in December 1944—the Battle of the Bulge. In a surprise attack in Belgium, German forces initially made gains but were ultimately pushed back due to fuel shortages and stiff Allied resistance. The failed offensive left Germany vulnerable to invasion.

    <button class="accordion" id="section8">The Holocaust and War’s End</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the full scale of the Holocaust became apparent as Allied forces liberated concentration camps. Survivors revealed the horrors of forced labor, starvation, and mass executions. The liberation of Dachau in April 1945 shocked the world, leading to war crimes trials, including the Nuremberg Trials, where Nazi leaders were held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In April 1945, the war in Europe reached its final stage. The Battle of Berlin saw fierce urban combat, with German forces consisting mostly of children and elderly men. Hitler committed suicide on April 30, and Germany unconditionally surrendered on May 8, marking V-E Day. The war’s aftermath led to the division of Germany and the start of the Cold War, reshaping global politics. World War II had lasting consequences, including the establishment of NATO, the formation of the United Nations, and a shift in U.S. foreign policy toward global leadership.
